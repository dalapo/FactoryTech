# FactoryTech
A tech mod for people who love automation.

Factory Tech adds the standard suite of machines, but with a twist: Instead of consuming power, machines require parts to run
that will wear out and need to be replaced. You can expect to be setting up a lot of automatic assembly lines.

It is intended to be used standalone or in a small modpack. Recommended mods to use Factory Tech with are automation mods such as
BuildCraft, Railcraft, and Thermal Dynamics (or AE2 and Ender IO if you're a WIMP).

FAQ/EAQ/NAQ:

Q: Can I use this mod in my modpack?

A: If your pack is going to be distributed to 10 people or less, you have my permission already (though I appreciate being notified). If is to be distributed to more than 10 people, you must ask me first; I reserve the right to ask however many questions I deem necessary before giving my permission. If it is an official FTB modpack, you have not only my permission but also my great thanks.

Q: Will you add x machine/item/feature?

A: Feel free to suggest things (I don't bite), but I have no obligation to include them. That being said, if it fits in well with the mod, is balanced, and I like it, probably!

Q: Your textures and icons suck!

A: Yes, they do. I am well aware of that. However, if you make me some better ones I'll put your name in the mod!

Q: [Feature]/[Mechanic] is so unrealistic!

A: Yes, yes it is. Although this is a more down-to-earth tech mod, I do take creative liberties (e.g. circuit crafting) where I deem necessary. On the topic of machines not using power, FactoryTech is balanced differently. Instead of needing to hook up a wall of machines to a Big Reactor (tm), you
keep them supplied with the parts they need. Making machines require both parts and power would be too cumbersome since you would have to hook up both a power line and a part supply line.

Q: Everything has too many steps to make! This is worse than GregTech!

A: Set up automation. That's the whole point.

Q: Why would I use this thing instead of Thermal Expansion which does everything this does but is easier?

A: Why would you use Thermal Expansion instead of this mod which does most things TE does but is more challenging? Different strokes
for different folks; this mod is designed for people who like engineering.

Q: Why do you have 3 different internet usernames?

A: "lucariomaster2" comes from circa 2009 when I first registered my MC username. I was young and foolish, a big Pokemon fan (that has not changed), and "lucariomaster" was taken. It's since become my go-to username for sites since it's always available. "ProfessorLucario" is my new, much-less-cringeworthy MC username that also reflects my skin. "dalapo", my GitHub name, was chosen since in the future having a Pokemon-related username might not be the best idea.

Q: What's your real name?

A: On the internet, nobody knows you're a platypus.

Q: What are your PC specs?

A: I don't have a PC. I write all my code using a magnetized needle and a steady hand.

Q: What Linux distro should I use?

A: I’d just like to interject for moment. What you’re refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!

Q: Why is this FAQ so random?

A: It's mine. I can do what I want.
