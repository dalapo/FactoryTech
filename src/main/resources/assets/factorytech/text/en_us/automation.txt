$title Transport Rollers
$brief %conveyor% Moves items around.
$recipe automation/rollers
Transport Rollers are the most basic method of moving items from Point A to Point B. Unlike other models of conveyor belts, these are purely metallic (a great improvement over slaughtering hordes of cows). Any items that fall on top of them will simply be moved in the direction of the rollers.
$end
$title Crate
$brief %crate% Stores items. Picks up broken parts from adjacent machines.
$recipe automation/crate
Crates can be used to store items. They only have 18 slots to the Chest's 27, but they do not connect, can be tiled infinitely and can still be accessed with a block above them.
They also look quite nice.
$end
$title Buffer Crate
$brief %buffercrate% Like a Crate but keeps 1 item in each slot.
$recipe automation/buffercrate
Buffer Crates are similar to regular Crates, but automation will never take the last item in a stack from them. This can be useful for making sure there is always space for certain items.
$end
$title Fan Lift
$brief %elevator% Pushes items straight up. Requires Redstone.
$recipe automation/fan
The Fan Lift is the main method of transporting items upwards. When given a Redstone signal, they will blow any items above them straight up by a distance equal to the received signal strength.
$end
$title Lift Receiver
$brief %bottomhatch% Catches items raised by fan.
$recipe automation/liftreceiver
Meant to be used with the Fan Lift, the Lift Receiver redirects any items entering its bottom hatch to its side one.
$end
$title Pulse Piston
$brief %itempusher% Pushes items. Can be filtered.
$recipe automation/pulsepiston
The Pulse Piston will push any items dropped in front of it, into an inventory if there is one where they would be shoved. Right-clicking will open a filter to set which items should be pushed, as well as to specify whether to use or ignore durability. This makes it extremely useful for separating items moving on Transport Rollers.
A Redstone signal disables it.
$end
$title Auto Puller
$brief %autopuller% Yanks items from inventories.
$recipe automation/autopuller
The Auto Puller automatically yanks items from an inventory adjacent to its input and puts them into the inventory at its output, or drops them into the world if the output is full or does not exist. A Redstone signal disables it.
$end
$title Insertion Hatch
$brief %hatch% Puts items into inventories.
$recipe automation/hatch
The opposite of the Auto Puller, the Insertion Hatch will put items that touch it into an adjacent inventory as long as there is space.
$end
$title Stack Mover
$brief %stackmover% Shifts items between inventories.
$recipe automation/stackmover
The Stack Mover, when given a Redstone signal, attempts to pull a single stack of items from an inventory on its input side and push it into the inventory on its output side. It always moves the first stack it finds that will fit into the target inventory. If there is no inventory adjacent to its output side, the stack is dropped into the world instead.
$end
$title Filtered Stack Mover
$brief %filtermover% Like a Stack Mover, but can be filtered.
$recipe automation/filtermover
An upgraded Stack Mover that has a filter to specify exactly which items to move and how many. It is useful for precise item allocation. It has two modes, Round Robin and First Match.
$end
$title Bulk Stack Mover
$brief %bulkmover% Like a Filtered Stack Mover, but moves everything at once.
$recipe automation/bulkmover
This is a further upgrade to the Filtered Stack Mover. Instead of moving one stack of items in its filter, it will attempt to move everything in its filter at once.
$end
$title Mounted Drill
$brief %blockbreaker% Breaks blocks in front of it.
$recipe automation/blockbreaker
The Mounted Drill is a device that breaks the block directly in front of it. In pulse mode it does this upon receiving a Redstone signal, while in continuous mode it does this once per second unless receiving a Redstone signal. Shift-right-click it with a Monkey Wrench to switch modes.
$end
$title Item Redistributor
$brief %itemredis% Takes items in through the top; spits them out the sides according to a ratio.
$recipe automation/itemredis
The Item Redistributor redirects items dropped into its top to one of its sides, according to a ratio specified by its GUI. You can also select whether to treat a stack as a single entity, or to split it.
$end
$title Sequential Placer
$brief %sequenceplacer% Places blocks in order.
$recipe automation/sequenceplacer
The Sequence Placer has an internal storage of 18 blocks. It places one in front of it, in the order they are, each time it receives a Redstone signal.
$end
$title Inventory Sensor
$brief %inventorysensor% Emits a Redstone signal if an attached inventory meets conditions.
$recipe automation/inventorysensor
The Inventory Sensor is a versatile way of detecting what is stored in a container. It has its own inventory in which you can specify which items to search for, and you can toggle Exactly/At Least, Match All/Any, and Use/Ignore Damage. It will emit a Redstone signal if the attached inventory meets the criteria.
$end
$title Item Interceptor
$brief %interceptor% Grabs items dropped near it.
$recipe automation/interceptor
The Item Interceptor is a powerful tool for farms and mob traps. Unless powered by a Redstone signal, it will grab all item entities created between 3 and 12 blocks away from it and store them in its internal inventory. Note that it cannot pick up items that are already in the world.
$end
$title Pipe
$recipe automation/pipe
Copper pipes are the primary method of moving liquids around. Thankfully, they don't seem to melt no matter how hot the fluid inside is.
They will not automatically pull liquid from anything; an Extraction Pump must be used to push fluids into them.
$end
$title Stationary Tank
$brief %tankblock% Holds liquids. Can be stacked or used for manual IO.
$recipe automation/tankblock
These tanks can hold up to 24 buckets of liquid each and will automatically attempt to insert fluid into another tank below them, making it possible to stack them. A Redstone signal disables this behaviour.
Insertion and extraction can be done from any side; the arrows on the top and bottom just indicate stacking behaviour. Manual I/O with buckets is also possible.
$end
$title Extraction Pump
$brief %fluidpuller% Pulls fluids from tanks and pushes them into pipes or similar.
$recipe automation/fluidpuller
The Extraction Pump automatically pulls liquid from any tanks connected to its input and inserts it into other fluid-accepting blocks, usually pipes.
$end
$title Water Collector
$brief %watercollector% Pulls water from rivers and oceans.
$recipe automation/watercollector
If placed in a river or ocean, the Water Collector will provide a steady and endless supply of water to an Extraction Pump above it.
$end
$title Stabilized Wormhole
$brief %planeshifter% Sends items to other dimensions.
Many dimensions are known to exist, beyond the one commonly called home: a superheated, endless cavern filled with lava; a stone island surrounded by endless void; universes willed into existence by scribbling in books. Ancient (though somewhat dubious) records even speak of an infinite labyrinth of alien madness, and a heavenly realm filled with crystals and puzzles.
$page
This device, when it receives a Redstone signal, will transport any items it contains to the dimension it is attuned to. They will appear in the target dimension at the same coordinates as they originated in, factoring in any geometric differences (for example, how 1 meter in the Nether equals 8 meters in the Overworld).
$page
Chorus Fruit is necessary to teleport the items, and the machine will consume one piece of fruit for every eight items it transports. Attuning the wormhole is a simple matter of crafting a Tuning Fork in the target dimension and right-clicking the Wormhole with it.
