$title Chop Saw
$recipe machines/saw
The Chop Saw applies wide, straight cuts to materials. Its main use is to convert logs into planks and planks into sticks more efficiently than by hand. It can also slice Quartz Blocks into blank circuit board substrates.
Parts required (back): Saw Blade, Gear
$end
$title Grindstone
$recipe machines/grindstone
The Grindstone, simply put, sharpens things. It converts Gears into Saw Blades and Nickel Ingots into Cutting Blades. In addition, it can apply one level of Efficiency or Sharpness to tools or weapons, to a maximum of III, at the cost of 25% of its remaining durability.
Parts required (back): Gear
$end
$title River Grate
$recipe machines/sluice
The River Grate collects metal nuggets that wash down rivers to generate a slow but steady supply of iron, copper, and nickel. It can also collect fish swimming downstream. To run, it must be in a River biome between y-level 60 and 70, and must be surrounded by sufficient water.
Parts required (any side): Wooden Mesh
$end
$title Metal Cutting Machine
$recipe machines/metalcutter
The Metal Mill is a more precise cutting machine than the Chop Saw, intended for precise metal cutting. Its main use is to cut wire from copper and gold ingots, but it can also make gears *much* more efficiently than by hand.
Parts required (bottom): Nickel Cutting Blade, Gear
$end
$title Autocrafting Unit
$recipe machines/autocrafter
The Autocrafting Unit, when given items in the shape of a valid recipe, will automatically craft said recipe and balance the input stack sizes as needed. It will not do a craft if any input stacks would be left empty unless said items do not stack in the first place.
Parts required: None
$end
$title Woodcutter
$recipe machines/woodcutter
The Woodcutter will chop down any trees that grow directly in front of it, making it a key component for farming. It takes some time to fully cut through the tree, but will harvest the entire tree at once when it does.
Parts required (back): Saw Blade, Advanced Motor
$end
$title Drill Grinder
$recipe machines/drill
The Drill Grinder is, well, a drill that grinds things. It can convert one Ore block into two units of dust, each of which can be smelted into an ingot; it can also convert stone to gravel and gravel to sand.
Parts required (top): Advanced Motor, Drill, Wire
$end
$title Magnetizer
$recipe machines/magnetizer
The Magnetizer's one and only job is to magnetize iron ingots. To do this, it rotates them at extreme speeds while subjecting them to an alternating current field. In addition to the normal machine parts, it requires a constant, alternating on/off Redstone signal to run.
Parts required (bottom): Advanced Motor, Wire
$end
$title Electric Furnace
$recipe machines/elecfurnace
The Electric Furnace, in addition to smelting slightly faster than a regular Furnace, can handle a few extra recipes that require a more precise temperature.
Parts required (back): Heating Element, Wire
$end
$title Centrifuge
$recipe machines/centrifuge
The Centrifuge, as you would expect, spins things around fast enough that they separate into their components. In addition to getting an extra nugget from ore dusts, it can reliably extract flint from gravel.
Parts required (back): Advanced Motor, Shaft, Gear
$end
$title Crucible
$recipe machines/crucible
The Crucible applies high enough temperatures to solids that they melt. It can also melt Netherrack into Lava and Glowstone into a liquid which makes up one of the components of Energite. If for some bizarre reason you need to turn ice back into water, it can do that too.
Parts required (bottom): Heating Element, Mixer
$end
$title Potion Mixer
$recipe machines/potionmixer
While many aspiring alchemists have sought a way to cram more than one effect into a bottle, potions seem to be averse to mixing when poured together. The Potion Mixer remedies that by piping normal potions into a central basin and then churning them until the different properties are forced together.
Parts required (back): Mixer, Gear
$end
$title Circuit Scribe
$recipe machines/circuitscribe
The Circuit Scribe etches circuit patterns onto blank quartz plates. One of four patterns must be specified by the GUI; different machines require different circuit patterns. For further information on circuits, see their page in the Parts Specifications.
Parts required (bottom): Nickel Cutting Blade, Advanced Motor, Heating Element
$end
$title Mining Machine
$recipe machines/autominer
The Mining Machine will automatically dig a wide hole down to bedrock, outputting all block drops. It works similarly to other models, though it is a bit more... "interesting"... than some others. By default it digs a 7x7 hole; a Range upgrade increases this to 15x15.
Parts required (any side): Drill, Circuit Board (Pattern 1), Advanced Motor
$end
$title Industrial Electroplater
$recipe machines/electroplater
The Industrial Electroplater dissolves materials in sulphuric acid and then uses an electric current to plate them onto wires. It can electroplate ore dusts to double them again as well as turning Redstone into Glowstone and sand into quartz. It must have something manually placed in the output slot to plate onto.
Parts required (back): Battery, Wire, Mixing Blades
$end
$title Mob Disassembler
$recipe machines/disassembler
The Mob Disassembler rapidly damages any creature (save for Players) that stands on top of it; in addition, mobs killed by it will drop much more loot than normal. Some may even drop loot they normally couldn't.
A Redstone signal disables it.
Parts required (bottom): Saw Blade, Circuit Board (Pattern 3), Battery
$end
$title Fluid Drill
$recipe machines/fluiddrill
The Fluid Drill digs a narrow, deep hole into the Earth and extracts either sulphur or propane, depending on where you place it. To function there cannot be any air or non-natural blocks between it and Bedrock.
Parts required (any side): Drill, Circuit Board (Pattern 2), Integrated Piston
$end
$title Fluid Agitator
$recipe machines/agitator
A key component in producing many resources, the Agitator churns up to two fluids and one item together to output up to one item and one fluid. Its main use is to produce sulphuric acid from sulphur and water.
Parts required (bottom): Mixing Blades, Advanced Motor, Circuit Board (Pattern 1)
$end
$title Agitator recipes
Water + Lava -> Stone
Sulphur + Water -> Sulphuric Acid
Liquefied Glowstone + Monster Dust -> Energite
Sand + Water -> Clay
Concrete Powder + Water -> Concrete
Redstone + Sulphur -> Blaze Powder
$end
$title Refrigeration Unit
$recipe machines/refrigerator
The Refrigerator cools liquids until they solidify, freezing water into ice and lava into obsidian. Oddly enough, it can also convert propane into coal.
Parts requried (back): Integrated Piston, Advanced Motor, Circuit Board (Pattern 3)
$end
$title Compression Chamber
$recipe machines/compressionchamber
$recipe parts/tankitem
The Compression Chamber compresses fluids to be stored in tanks; this can be done with water, propane, and sulphuric acid. In addition, attempting to fill a tank when the Compression Chamber's own tank is empty will instead fill it with compressed air. Finally, it is also used to fill Energy Core shells with Energite.
Parts required (back): Integrated Piston, Advanced Motor, Circuit Board (Pattern 4)
$end
$title Propane Furnace
$recipe machines/propanefurnace
The Propane Furnace uses compressed propane tanks to smelt items extremely quickly. One tank is good for eight smelts; however, it cannot do the precise recipes of the Electric Furnace.
Full tanks are inserted on the bottom; empty ones are pulled from the top.
Parts required: None, but consumes propane in tanks
$end
$title Tempering Oven
$recipe machines/temperer
Some machine parts can be tempered to increase their strength, and therefore their lifespan in machines. It can also temper iron tools, giving the equivalent of an Unbreaking I enchantment (doesn't stack). To run, it needs a sustained Redstone signal.
Parts required: Heating Element, Circuit Board (Pattern 3), Focusing Lens
$end
$title Tempering Oven (cont'd)
The Tempering Oven is not self-regulating. The Redstone signal must be turned off at exactly the right time; this time varies depending on the parts.
If the signal turns off too early, the process will simply fail; if it stays on for too long, the part will be destroyed.
Note that the tempering will not complete until the signal is actually turned off - removing the part will not suffice.
$end
$title Core Charger
$recipe machines/corecharger
This machine runs an intense electric current through unfinished energy cores, charging them up. It is important to note that fully charging cores is extremely dangerous; optimal efficiency is achieved at 80%. Above that causes it to take longer to stabilize, and charging a core above 100% can cause an explosive overflow.
Parts required (back): Battery, Circuit Boards (1 and 2), Magnet
$end
$title Stabilization Table
$recipe machines/stabilizer
$recipe machines/magnetblock
To stabilize a charged Energy Core for use in machines, it must be put on a Stabilization Table and surrounded with active Redstone Magnets. See "Core Stabilization" in the Parts section for more information.
Parts required: None, but requires a setup with Stationary Magnets
$end
$title Biosynthesis Unit
$recipe machines/spawner
The Biosynthesizer, although unable to fully duplicate the Mob Spawners found in dungeons, comes close. Given the necessary parts and a sample of the creature's drops (to clone from), it can produce a steady supply of them which are dropped directly under it.
Parts required (top): Energy Core, Circuit Board (Pattern 2), Battery, Gear
$end
$title Mob Disruptor
$recipe machines/disruptor
The Mob Disruptor emits powerful radio waves that, while harmless to players, freeze mobs in place. In addition, it stops Endermen from teleporting.
Parts required (any side): Energy Core, Magnet, Circuit Board (Pattern 4), Integrated Piston
$end
$title Negative Ion Disperser
$recipe machines/iondisperser
The Negative Ion Disperser releases charged particles that improve the health and morale of nearby players and mobs. In more concrete terms, it gives nearby creatures random burst of either Speed, Jump Boost, Haste, Strength, or Regeneration.
Parts required (any side): Energy Core, Circuit Board (Pattern 3), Circuit Board (Pattern 4), Battery
$end
$title Tesla Coil
$recipe machines/teslacoil
This machine builds up electric charge to zap mobs and players, making it a powerful form of base defence. Any creature wearing a full suit of Chainmail armour is immune to it as the chainmail forms a Faraday cage.
Parts required (any side): Battery, Wire
$end
$title Universal Supercharger
$recipe machines/energizer
The Universal Supercharger can be placed adjacent to any machine to make it run twice as fast. To function, it requires a steady supply of Energy Cores.
