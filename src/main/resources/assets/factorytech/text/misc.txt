$title Comparator Behaviour
If a machine is used as the input of a Redstone Comparator, it will output a full-strength signal if the machine is missing any parts.

$title Upgrading machines
If the ordinary performance of a machine is unsatisfactory or unfitting for your assembly line, they can be upgraded in one of five ways by crafting the corresponding upgrade and right-clicking the machine with it. A machine can only have one upgrade installed.
$end
$title Upgrade: Overclock
$recipe machines/upgrade_overclock
This upgrade makes the machine work twice as fast, but lowers the number of operations each part has before being able to break, and then makes them more likely to break after that.
$end
$title Upgrade: Underclock
$recipe machines/upgrade_underclock
This upgrade makes the machine work half as fast, but raises the number of operations each part has before being able to break, and then makes them less likely to break after that.
$end
$title Upgrade: Range
For machines that interact with the world around them, the Range upgrade increases their effective radius. It does not affect machines such as the Drill Grinder which do not interact with the world.
$end
$title Upgrade: Consistency
The Consistency upgrade doubles the amount of operations each part can do without being able to break, but makes them break immediately after that.
$end
$title Upgrade: Efficiency
The Efficiency upgrade increases the chance that broken parts in a machine can be salvaged.

$title Brick variants
$recipe deco/bricks_sandy
$recipe deco/bricks_earthy
$recipe deco/bricks_charcoal
$recipe deco/bricks_ash
Different colours of bricks can be crafted to suit a wide variety of buildings, industrial or otherwise.
$end
$title Sheet Metal
$recipe deco/metal_patterned
$recipe deco/metal_rivets
$recipe deco/metal_smooth
$recipe deco/metal_rusted
$recipe deco/metal_siding
$recipe deco/metal_caution
If bricks are a bit too old-fashioned, sheet metal is another building option.
$end
$title Smokestacks
$recipe deco/smokestack_brick
$recipe deco/smokestack_sbrick
$recipe deco/smokestack_ebrick
$recipe deco/smokestack_cbrick
$recipe deco/smokestack_abrick
$recipe deco/smokestack_stone
$recipe deco/smokestack_stonebrick
$recipe deco/smokestack_iron
$recipe deco/smokestack_pmetal
Smokestacks are craftable in many variations to put the finishing touch on your environmentally (un)friendly assembly lines.
(Note: they must be crafted in the centre column of the workbench.)
