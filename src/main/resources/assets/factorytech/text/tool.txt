$title Element Sword
$recipe elementsword
Attaching a Heating Element to a Circuit Board and mounting it on a shaft makes a decent weapon. It has equal damage and durability to an iron sword and sets mobs on fire for 6 seconds.
Keep in mind that it's essentially an exposed electrical cable on a stick, so holding it while in water is not advised.

$title Pressure Gun
$recipe pressuregun
The Pressure Gun uses filled tanks of fluid as a weapon. It has different range, damage, and knockback depending on the contents of the tank, detailed on the next page.
It doesn't seem to affect squids at all - in fact, it almost seems like it was designed by them.
